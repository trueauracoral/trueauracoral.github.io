<h3>Coding Projects</h3>
<p>I have created multiple scripts and small projects in the past nothing to special. This list will one day hopefully mark my future projects. It might never do so.</p>

<p>A wise man said to create 20 games to build a foundation in game development. <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/">This wise man</a> made me start to create games finally.</p>
<p>The games are available on my <a href="https://trueauracoral.itch.io/">itch.io (less updated)</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/trueauracoral">GitHub (latest updates are here)</a></p>

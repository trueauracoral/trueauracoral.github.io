* Seen it Twice, Save it Right
One thing in life that I hate is losing things that I once had. Generally speaking I have found a rule to fight against this on the internet which is that if I really like something that I saw, watched, read/viewed I bookmark it. If I have seen a video 2 times and liked it on the second watch through then it definitely needs to be saved. Liking a piece of content is usually can be determined if itâ€™s something that makes you laugh or smile. Unfortunately not every piece of content that you want to see again is something that makes you laug or smile.

Sometimes for example I find a music piece that I liked and was super catchy like this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4STB7h3EU]]. I think that I saw it in a youtube short so int he moment I didn't think to save it and obviously didn't know the name of it. It was a pain to find it and add it immediately to my music bops where it belongs.

Videos must be categorized into a playlist as well as sent into my likes section so that way I do not lose it. Same goes for web pages. Finding stuff that isn't saved at all is much harder than finding stuff that is at least in a playlist, as well in my browser history if worst comes to worst. 

Another example of the pain of not saving things is this: [[https://new.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1av0pgo/tomtvideo20172019_game_developer_who_is_a_blender/]].
I vividly remember watching this video but I can't find it. If only I liked the video and at least could search for it. And youtube search is horrible by the way. 

So always save and like your stuff. You never know when you will want to see something the next time. My memory has improved however and most things I can remember the name of.

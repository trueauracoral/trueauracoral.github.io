All Super Smash Bros games I am 95% sure (have not tested) can work in emulators. From the begining Super Smash Bros has placed an emphasis on the usage of an analog stick for many attacks and movements. Theorettically a keyboard should work but you can't go 45 degrees. https://keyboard.gg/ aims to combat this by making keys assigned to 45 degree analog stick movements. Maybe similar functionality could be modded into emulators but for now I think you need a controller/analog stick.

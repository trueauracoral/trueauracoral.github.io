New Evee evolution speculation is happening right now and I would like to give my take on all the possible ones that could happen. Maybe I will draw one of the likely new Evee evolutions to come out. These are the ones that are available to work with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Bug
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Poison
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Flying
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rock
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ground
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dragon
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Steel
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fighting
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ghost
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, a lot of them I think are unlikely to happen.
</p>
<h1 id="org-d659704a55">IMPOSSIBLE TO HAPPEN (In my opinion)</h1><h2 id="org-1751a7ae1c">Dragon</h2><p>
Evee doesn&#39;t look like a lizard animal like most dragon types. Evee looks more like a combination of a dog and a cat. So dragon doesn&#39;t fit in my opinion.
</p>
<h2 id="org-e20a7adb2c">Steel</h2><p>
Evee doesn&#39;t look like a peice of metal, like most steel types. So once again just doesn&#39;t fit in my opinion. At less somehow a peice of metal gets attached to it. Unlikely I think.
</p>
<h2 id="org-a4f2b66833">Fighting</h2><p>
Evee is litterally a normal type. So if it evolved into a fighting type that would be weird because evee originally a normal type has a weakness towards fighting types.
</p>
<h2 id="org-f3ec817a7b">Ghost</h2><p>
Evee evolving into a ghost type would mean, a little cute evee death happened...
</p>
<h1 id="org-681354eb29">POSSIBLE TO HAPPEN!</h1><h2 id="org-48562b537c">Bug</h2><p>
An evee bug type would be pretty cool. The transformation from this soft puppy to an insect will be interesting.
</p>
<h2 id="org-7215595bd7">Poison</h2><p>
Evee gaining the ability to release toxins or inject toxins either way would be epic. Possibly some stinger on the tail. However, they need to keep evee still cute.
</p>
<h2 id="org-f25c21608e">Flying</h2><p>
Evee growing wings would be interesting, given that evee has been firmly put on the ground all of it&#39;s life.
</p>
<h2 id="org-7f78051bdf">Rock</h2><p>
Evee freaking throwing rocks and having a tail made out of rocks will be very cool.
</p>
<h2 id="org-2950a19efe">Ground</h2><p>
IDK what evee&#39;s going to do by being a ground type.

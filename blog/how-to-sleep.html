I have for the longest time since about early 2020 had issues of bringing my phone to my bed hindering my sleep. I in the later half of 2025. Conquered this however i still make this mistake sometimes. At least it&#39;s not as bad as it once was.
</p>
<p>
The biggest thing is that bringing your phone to your bed is a habit. It&#39;s a choice you make that you must fight. Like any habit you must be able to say <b>&#34;NO&#34;</b> to yourself, make that a habit.
</p>
<h1 id="org-5cac42ca44">Choice: do not bring the phone to bed. FIGHT YOUR DEMONS</h1><ul>
<li>
<p>
you must wrestle with your sleep and try to sleep.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
KEEP PUSHING TILL  YOU REACH SLEEP. An effective strategy for me is to just keep on pondering and thinking till eventually without realizing it you just fall asleep
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If only there was button that just magically made you go to sleep
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
However, using drugs is bad
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It takes 3 days to get a normal sleep schedule I heard somewhere
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="org-cc8415ff0c">Tiredness</h1><ul>
<li>
<p>
Being tired is the easiest method to go to sleep. It&#39;s so easy to take a nap when you&#39;re tired but that will take away the ability to sleep when it counts. Be physically tired and sleeping is easy.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Sleep Schedule the more days which you have a good sleep the easier it gets
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mental being mentally tired helps a lot.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Physical tiredness is the method I used for a long time as a child to get to sleep. it is extremely effective
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="org-ca45634193">The intracies of how I get to bed</h1><ol>
<li>
<p>
 Head, jaw, face, muscles and everything should be relaxed. My limbs must be straighted out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 I can only get to sleep by sleeping frontwards or on my back. However when I go to sleep on my back I usually wake up on my front somehow.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 No body part should be on another because that retracts blood flow
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 I can only get sleep with my head tilted towards the left but most of the time I need a pillow to prop it up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 My full body must be completely coverd in a blanket. I can sleep without a blanket though sometimes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 I must be tired in order to go to sleep
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 All thoughts must be pushed away in order to get into a good stage of sleep. Basically I must forget that I exist
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Having all suroundings pitch black is good. Unplug all light sources.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 No noise helps
</p>
</li>
